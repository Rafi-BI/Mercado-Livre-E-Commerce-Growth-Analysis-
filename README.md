Mercado-Livre-E-Commerce-Growth-Analysis
To help Mercado Livre identify key areas of growth and improvement by analyzing customer
trends, sales performance, fulfillment metrics, and financial behavior — ultimately supporting
strategic decision-making and improving marketplace efficiency.
Project Objective:
Mercado Livre, a leading Brazilian e-commerce platform, aims to optimize its marketplace
operations by gaining deeper insights into customer behavior, seller performance, product
trends, and fulfillment efficiency. The goal is to uncover growth opportunities, improve customer
experience, and forecast future sales trends to support data-driven decision-making.
Tools & Technologies Used:
1. SQL – For data extraction and advanced query-based insights
2. Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – For Exploratory Data Analysis and trend
modeling
3. Power BI – For building interactive, multi-page dashboards with navigational buttons and
insightful KPIs
4. Excel – For initial data wrangling and visualization prototyping

Key Areas of Analysis:
1. Customer Analytics:
1. Top 10 customers contributed most to lifetime revenue
2. Only ~3% of users placed more than one order – revealing low retention
3. First purchase happens within a few days of account creation – opportunity for quick
onboarding optimization
2. Revenue & Sales Trends:
1. Steady month-over-month growth
2. Revenue peaked during Q4 (Nov–Dec) – seasonal spikes aligned with holiday sales
3. AOV (Average Order Value) showed an upward trend, hitting $160.99
3. Product Performance:
1. Top categories: Cama, Mesa & Banho, Beleza & Saúde, Relógios & Presentes
2. 32.9K products analyzed across 71 categories
3. Returns spiked early 2018 – signaling product/customer mismatch or quality issues
4. Seller Performance:
1. 3,095 active sellers analyzed
2. Seller with highest revenue exceeded $220K

3. Average delivery time: 12.5 days
4. Delivery performance had direct correlation with customer review scores
5. Operations & Fulfillment:
1. 99.36% of orders were successfully delivered
2. Freight cost per order averaged $19.99
3. Cancellation rate was just 0.64%
4. Delivery time improved dramatically from 55 to ~12 days over time
6. Payment Behavior:
1. Credit cards made up 75% of payments and 79% of revenue
2. Credit card payments had the highest average review scores
3. Notable drop in transactions during Sep–Oct – requires further investigation
Python EDA & Time-Series Trend Analysis:
1. Built time-series dataset of monthly revenue
2. Identified seasonal peaks and dips
3. Found December as the strongest sales month and July/February as off-peak months
Business Insights:
1. High-value buyers drive majority of revenue – retention should be a strategic focus
2. Operational efficiency (delivery speed) directly impacts customer satisfaction
3. Seasonality is a key factor – Q4 is the most critical time for revenue planning
4. Credit cards are the top-performing payment method, both in volume and satisfaction
5. Returns and cancellations are relatively low, but post-sales improvement is needed
